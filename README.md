3. Go to the root directory of the project and run the following command: `python -m venv .`

## Side Note

You may need to install the Jupyter Notebook Renderers extension for VS Code to render the graphs in the notebook. You can install it [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter-renderers). Then, change the presentation of your Notebook's output cell to `application/vnd.plotly.v1+json`.
